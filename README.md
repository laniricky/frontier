## About

Frontier is [a short description of the project — what problem it solves and who it’s for]. Provide a quick elevator pitch and any high-level goals or design principles.

Example:
- Build fast, scalable APIs with minimal configuration.
- Provide an extensible framework for plugins and integrations.

## Features

- Feature 1 — short explanation
- Feature 2 — short explanation
- Feature 3 — short explanation
- [Optional] Roadmap and planned improvements

## Tech stack

Replace these placeholders with the actual stack you use:

- Language(s): [e.g., TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, Go]
- Framework(s): [e.g., Node/Express, Next.js, FastAPI]
- Database: [e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB, SQLite]
- Other: Docker, GitHub Actions, etc.

## Prerequisites

Install the tools you need before getting started:

- Git >= 2.x
- Node.js >= 16.x (or the version your project requires) — if applicable
- Python >= 3.8 — if applicable
- Docker & Docker Compose — if applicable

## Getting started

1. Clone the repository
   git clone https://github.com/laniricky/frontier.git
   cd frontier

2. Install dependencies

- Node (example)
  npm install
  or
  pnpm install
  or
  yarn install

- Python (example)
  python -m venv .venv
  source .venv/bin/activate
  pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Create environment configuration
   - Copy .env.example to .env and fill in the required variables:
     cp .env.example .env
     # then edit .env

4. Start the development server

- Node (example)
  npm run dev

- Python (example)
  uvicorn app.main:app --reload

If your project uses Docker:
  docker-compose up --build

## Configuration

Explain important configuration values and environment variables. Example:

- PORT — the port the app runs on (default: 3000)
- DATABASE_URL — connection string for the database
- SECRET_KEY — cryptographic secret used for sessions or JWTs

Include a sample or link to .env.example.

## Usage

Provide examples of common tasks and API usage (if applicable).

- Run a one-off script:
  npm run migrate
- Start background workers:
  npm run worker
- Example API calls:
  curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/health

Add code snippets and example responses that help new users understand how to interact with the project.

## Development

Guidance for contributors working on the codebase:

- Branching model (e.g., feature branches off main)
- Coding style and linters:
  - ESLint, Prettier, Black, etc.
- Commit message format (e.g., Conventional Commits)
- How to run the app locally (links to the Getting started section)

## Testing

Explain how to run tests and what testing frameworks are used.

- Run unit tests:
  npm test
  or
  pytest

- Run linters:
  npm run lint
  npm run format

- CI: Describe any GitHub Actions or CI configuration that runs on push/PR.

## Deployment

Describe how to deploy the project in production (manual steps, CI pipelines, or hosting platforms).

- Example with Docker:
  docker build -t frontier:latest .
  docker run -e DATABASE_URL=... -p 80:80 frontier:latest

- Example with a cloud provider (Vercel, Netlify, Heroku, etc.)

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a feature branch: git checkout -b feat/your-feature
3. Run tests and linters locally.
4. Open a pull request describing your changes.

If you'd like, I can:
- Customize this README for the specific tech stack you use (Node/Python/Go/etc.)
- Add CI badges, coverage status, and installation commands tailored to your project
- Create a LICENSE, CONTRIBUTING.md, CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md, and a GitHub Actions CI workflow

Tell me which of the above you'd like next and provide any project-specific details (language, framework, commands).
